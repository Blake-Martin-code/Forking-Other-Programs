# Forking-Other-Programs
This program demonstrates my knowledge and ability to Fork and create parent and child processes. As well as running a separate program at the same time as the initial program that is running

To run and inspect this program, download and unpack the tar file in a new directory on your machine. This program is written in the C language and uses gcc to compile.

There is another README.txt file inisde the tar file that further explains how to run the program.

The goal of this program is to Fork a parent and child process 3 times so they run sequentially and in the child process run another program(executable file) then wait for it to return.
